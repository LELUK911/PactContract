## 🦡 Overview

Iron Badger Brotherhood is a next-generation DeFi ecosystem designed to unlock new credit primitives, composable tokenized agreements, and dynamic financial coordination through modular protocols. Our flagship product, **Iron Pact**, introduces a revolutionary layer of programmable, peer-to-peer lending agreements represented as semi-NFTs (ERC-1155), enabling fairer, more flexible, and decentralized lending mechanics.

## 🏗️ Protocol Architecture

The Iron Badger Brotherhood ecosystem consists of multiple interconnected modules that work together to create a comprehensive DeFi lending and trading platform:

### Core Modules

- **🔗 Iron Pact**: The flagship decentralized P2P lending protocol powered by semi-NFTs
- **🚀 Iron Forge**: Primary market interface where borrowers can propose lending agreements
- **📈 Iron Rise**: Ascending auction markets for dynamic debt trading
- **📉 Iron Fall**: Descending auction markets for debt speculation and repositioning
- **🎮 Iron Knite**: DAO gaming mechanics with defikindom integration (planned)
- **🌐 Iron Realms**: On-chain gaming integration with lending dynamics (planned)
- **🏛️ Iron DAO**: Ecosystem governance powered by token holders and reputation NFTs (planned)

## ✨ Key Innovation: Iron Pact

### Revolutionary Lending Mechanics

**Iron Pact** reimagines secured lending in the DeFi space by leveraging representative semi-NFTs that reflect peer-to-peer lending agreements. Each lending agreement is tokenized as an ERC-1155 semi-NFT, making them tradable, programmable, and verifiable on-chain.
